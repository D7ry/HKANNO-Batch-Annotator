# HKXEditor
convenience tool to batch edit hkx, untested. Now only supports adding attackStart annos for new Skysa.

How to use:

1.download hkanno64, put it into D:\hkanno64-001 (file has to be named exactly like that). In other words, in D:\hkanno64-001 folder directly contains hkanno64.exe.

2.put whatever you want to convert into D:\hkxconvert

3.run the main program, and it should automatically add attackStart annotations.
